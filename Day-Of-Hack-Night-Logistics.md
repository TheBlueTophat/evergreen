There are a handful of things that we did in preparation for and during hack night. This was written for running Hack Night in the second floor of the Bechtel Innovation Design Center.

## General Timeline

### (Ideally) <8:00 PM
- [ ] Obtain Hack Cart from Lawson. This contains supplies and a handful of projects. You will need to use the elevators in both Lawson and Bechtel.

### 8:00 PM
- [ ] Set up projector with the Hack Night Dashboard. We usually use Matthew's iPad but any spare device that can connect to the projector could work.
- [ ] Set up Door-Opener.
- [ ] Make sure weekly badges are out.
- [ ] Make sure weekly stamp is out along with the ink pad.

### ~9:00 PM
- [ ] Order pizza (see the other document in evergreen going over the details of that). Time may vary. Our goal was to do it "in the middle of hack night".
- [ ] Sessions and Reading Circle timeslots begin. They can occur whenever but generally start a bit into hack night, and generally are given single-hour increment blocks of time. 
- [ ] Passport making ceremony times also begin around this time.

### ~10:00 PM 
- [ ] Pizza gets delivered.
  - [ ] Make sure there is enough counter space for the pizza.
  - [ ] Put plates/napkins out.

### 11:59 PM
- [ ] Countdown happens during approximately the last minute of Hack Night, using the Dashboard as the countdown timer.

### 12:00 AM
- [ ] "Demos" happens. Generally, people are given about 2 minutes to show what they are working on.

### ??:?? AM: Whenever hack night ends
Hack Night ends when the last person leaves. The way we counted if Hack Night was occurring was if 3 people were present, 2 of which at least must be awake. An approximate average time for Hack Night to end is around 6 AM, but that varies a lot.
- [ ] Throw away all pizza boxes into trash cans.
- [ ] Put any tables and chairs back where they originally came from.
- [ ] Put badges bag on the Hack Cart.
- [ ] Put stamp stuff back away on the Hack Cart.
- [ ] Put away any Passport making things on the Hack Cart.
  - [ ] If there is any trash leftover from making passports, throw it away.
- [ ] Put door opener away onto Hack Cart. You might want to wait to do this until the cart is on the first floor for convenience sake.
- [ ] Unplug device from projector that has the dashboard, put it away.
- [ ] Put away any other Purdue Hackers projects back onto the Hack Cart as well (assuming the project was being stored there).
- [ ] Take Hack Cart back to the Purdue Hackers office in Lawson.
